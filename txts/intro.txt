   <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>You may have found that when you tried to visit a site related to your studies at school or at home, it was
      blocked by filtering.<br>
      But it doesn't have to be that way.
      Ihurem is a website that displays the sites you want to see in an iframe. Ihurem could be the solution to your
      unreasonable filtering problems.</p>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>ihurem is controlled by an HTML element called <strong>iframe</strong>.<br>
      &lt;Iframe&gt; is an HTML element that represents a nested viewing context and allows other pages to be embedded
      within the current HTML page.</p>
    <h1>Use Ihurem</h1>
    <p>Ihurem supports both online and offline usage.<br>
      Want to customize Ihurem? You can download the source from <a
        href="https://github.com/eimax9668/ihurem.github.io">GitHub</a> and build your own Ihurem.</p><br>
