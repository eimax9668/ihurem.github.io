<p>
Ihurem displays the text of some pages in a special way to prevent them from being filtered out for reasons such as filter evasion.
<br>
Texts containing words to be blocked are stored in a separate folder.<br><br>
<code>fetch('txts/intro.txt')<br>
    .then(response => response.text())<br>
    .then(text => {<br>
    document.getElementById('introtxt').innerHTML = text;<br>
    });</code><br>
    Filtering is not blocked because it cannot refer to the txt file.<br><br>
